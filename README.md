# RightScript
RightScript is a TypeScript fork that aims to be 100% TypeScript Compatible via typescript-rightscript bridge that installs as typescript so that other tooling can pick it up.


RightScript got invented as TypeScript did many things right but major things wrong and the Project showed that it does not get Upgrades into the Source fast and stable so there was a need for a Porject that is based on all good TypeScript Concepts and the valueable parts of the codebase while still allow fast evolution and adoption. We plan to adopt many 3th party projects from the community directly into RightScript to give the developer a better and more consistent dev expirence

A other Importent factor that this exists is that we at https://dspeed.eu needed a ECMA2021 Build of it to run it more performant on our Platform and in our Code Editors.

## Main Features
- Working CJS and ESM Interop. ***Not Aiming NODEJS Package.json Compatible Algo without Plugin*** we default for everything to ESM Only and you should try to transpil everything to ESM befor you work with it.


## Contributing

The Project is at present only maintained by Frank Lemanschik on a private need base while it is Apache 2.0 Licenced and is willing and welcoming contributions from other projects and the whole community.
